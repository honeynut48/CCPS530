        <p>"Jane Eyre (originally published as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography) is a novel by the English writer Charlotte Brontë. It was published under her pen name "Currer Bell" on 19 October 1847 by Smith, Elder & Co. of London. The first American edition was published in January 1848 by Harper & Brothers of New York. Jane Eyre is a bildungsroman that follows the experiences of its eponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr Rochester, the brooding master of Thornfield Hall.

            The novel revolutionised prose fiction, being the first to focus on the moral and spiritual development of its protagonist through an intimate first-person narrative, where actions and events are coloured by a psychological intensity. Charlotte Brontë has been called the "first historian of the private consciousness" and the literary ancestor of writers such as Marcel Proust and James Joyce.
            
            The book contains elements of social criticism with a strong sense of Christian morality at its core, and it is considered by many[who?] to be ahead of its time because of Jane's individualistic character and how the novel approaches the topics of class, sexuality, religion and feminism.[5][6] Jane Eyre, along with Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, is one of the most famous romance novels.[7] It is considered one of the greatest novels in the English language,[8] and in 2003 was ranked as the tenth best-loved book in Britain by the BBC in The Big Read poll."</p>
